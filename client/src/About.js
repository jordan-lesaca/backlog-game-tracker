        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Thank you for checking out our website. <br/>
            Backlog Game Tracker was brought to you by a one man team. <br/>
            This developer is hoping to create an application where groups of friends can join and share whats on their list <br/>
            The purpose is many, but one is to bring your friends together and have a place where you can share what games you're interested in, <br/>
            what you have in your backlog, and possibly even trading so you can skip buying that game you've been having your eye on. <br/>
            Stay tuned for more updates!    
        </p>

        <h2>The Developer</h2>
        <p> A novice at coding, but is on his way. Jordan is a gamer from Seattle that would spend hours gaming when he was younger. <br/>
        He didn't grow up in the wealthiest conditions, and wasn't able to partake in a lot of things that cost money (which is everything), <br/>
        However, he was occassionally given a game to play with during his free time. He thought, it would be nice if my friends and I <br/>
        had a quick and convenient way of knowing who had what. Then they could trade amongst each other and not have to go out getting a game that someone he knew already finished and had stored away, collecting dust. <br/>
        Here is hoping this brings gaming access to others, in a more effecient way amongst your group of friends. 
        </p>

        <h2>Please note, this is not a real website and the only trading that will be going on is amongst yourself. Which is not a thing. </h2>
